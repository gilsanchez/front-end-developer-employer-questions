<p>The Front-end Job Interview Questions list (<a href="https://github.com/darcyclarke/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions">https://github.com/darcyclarke/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions</a>) is pretty awesome--if you're an employer. It gave me the idea to have a list of questions for front-end developers to ask prospective employers.</p>
